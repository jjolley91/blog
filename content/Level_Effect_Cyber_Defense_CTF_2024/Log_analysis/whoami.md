### What tactic was the attacker employing based on this command history? (1 word)

![commands](https://github.com/jjolley91/blog/blob/main/static/le_ctf_24/commands.png?raw=true)

From the given image, we can see that the commands are all designed to gather information on the system therefore the answer is: enumeration


Enumeration in the context of cybersecurity refers to the systematic process of gathering information about a target system, network, or application. This involves identifying resources, configurations, and services that are accessible and potentially exploitable. Techniques used in enumeration include querying services like DNS, NetBIOS, LDAP, and SNMP, as well as port scanning and vulnerability scanning to uncover open ports, active services, usernames, shares, and other network details. The goal is to build a comprehensive map of the target's environment to identify potential attack vectors and weaknesses.
