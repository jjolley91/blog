### You know the deal - join the disc, make sure your eyes work, don't go crazy.

### Take a look around in #general on the Level Effect Discord server and something might catch your eye. It might be a ways back.

All you need to do here is join the discord, and go to the [General](https://discord.com/channels/755445294052933632/755447136178405514) channel. Then you can simply ```Ctl+f``` and type ```leveleffect{``` in the search bar. Scrolling down a ways will yield the flag posted by one of the admins.
