## Back to Basics 1:

### What is one IPv4 address resolved from the leveleffect.com domain?


## Back to Basics 2:

### Which nameserver is the SOA (Start of Authority) for the leveleffect.com domain?

For each of these, all we need to do is look at the DNS records of the domain. There are several tools which can be used to do this, but I decided to use [Domain Dossier](https://centralops.net/co/domaindossier.aspx), which displayed both answers in one result.
