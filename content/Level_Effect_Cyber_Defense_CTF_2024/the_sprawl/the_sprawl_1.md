# The Sprawl 1 Challenge series:
 

 Every challenge in this series can be solved simply by running strings.exe on theLock.dll inside the sprawl folder....Solving them in the intended way by running theSprawl.exe will lead you through a short Q&A in which you will need to do some research on the Shadowrun wiki and supply the correct solutions.
