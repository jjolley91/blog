### Can you find this iconic location?

#### This is the chall2 challenge for the "HuntressCTF2023" challenges on https://osint.golf. It's a lot like Geoguesser if you have ever played :) 


For this challenge we are given another link to [Geosint](https://osint.golf/HuntressCTF2023-chall1/) which presents us with a street view of a location somewhere in the world.

After spending some time looking around the landscape, we decided to screenshot the building and do a Google Image Search.

The search result immedately returned a picture of the building and named it Frost Meadowcroft, and even gave us the address! We then searched for the address on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) to get it's location. From there we were able to navigate to the same location on the Geosint site and click the building to retrieve the flag!
