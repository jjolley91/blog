### They say you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but this is one of my favorites!

For this challenge we are given a book.rar file to download. However running:
```bash 
file book.rar
```
reveals that this is, in fact, a png image file. We can simply view the image to receive the flag:

![book](https://github.com/jjolley91/blog/blob/main/static/Huntress_CTF_2023/book_by_cover.png?raw=true)

This goes to show that file extensions are not always indicative of the actual file type. It is important to check in case of errors.
