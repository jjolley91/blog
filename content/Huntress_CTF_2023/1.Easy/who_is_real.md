### This is not a technical challenge, but it is a good test of your eye!

### Now we live in a world of generative AI, for better or for worse. The fact of the matter is, threat actors can scheme up fake personas to lure you into a scam or social engineering... so, can you determine which profile picture is real and which is fake?

### Play a game to train yourself on identifying what stands out for AI generated people. After a streak of 5 correct selections, you'll receive the flag!

As the challenge description stated, this is not a very technical challenge.  Here we are given a url which brings us to a page asking us to choose between two pictures of human faces, one being real and the other being AI generated. We are asked to choose the real one.

Here are some things to look for when trying to tell the real image from the generated one:

Symmetry and Flaws: AI-generated images often exhibit a high degree of symmetry and a lack of imperfections. Real human faces have natural asymmetry and minor flaws, such as skin imperfections or hair irregularities.

Uncanny Valley: Some AI-generated faces may fall into the "uncanny valley," a term used to describe images or animations that are very close to looking human but still appear eerie or artificial. Real faces do not typically trigger this response.

Lighting and Shadows: Pay attention to lighting and shadows. In AI-generated images, lighting may not always appear consistent or realistic, leading to unusual highlights and shadows.

Background and Context: Examine the context of the image. AI-generated faces might appear out of place in certain backgrounds or situations, while real faces naturally fit into their environments.

Expression: Facial expressions in AI-generated images may not always convey genuine emotions and can sometimes appear odd or forced.

Details: Real photographs often contain fine details that AI-generated images may not capture accurately. Look for subtle features like freckles, moles, or individual hair strands.

Resolution: AI-generated images might exhibit inconsistencies in resolution, especially at higher zoom levels.

Consistency: When viewing multiple AI-generated faces side by side, you may notice a lack of diversity in facial features or expressions. Real faces have a broad range of natural variations.

Artifacts: AI-generated images may contain artifacts or unusual patterns, especially in the background or on the face.

Exaggeration: Some AI tools tend to exaggerate certain facial features or distort proportions, making it easier to identify them as generated.

It's important to note that AI technology is rapidly evolving, and the ability to generate highly convincing images is improving. As a result, some AI-generated images may closely resemble real photos, making it increasingly challenging to differentiate between the two. When in doubt, verifying the source or relying on additional information is a good practice, as it can be challenging to identify AI-generated images with complete certainty through visual inspection alone.
